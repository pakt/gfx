3D programming in PostScript. 

cube.inc, epsetup.inc and ps3d.inc are from:
http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/graphics/manual/

self-contained.ps will run on GhostView on windows. GS on linux will fail to
render anything x_x

This thing first generates all objects and their colors, then sorts all 
"pixels" by Z and draws them.
